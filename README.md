# Malware-Analysis-Toolkit-1.0

This toolkit is designed to provide a new solution of open-source, Windows-based malware analysis tools. The toolkit consists of 13 free / open-source tools which include sandboxes, disassemblers, de-compilers, debuggers, text editors, packet sniffers and more. The tools are:

    ANY.RUN
    Autoruns
    Detect It Easy
    Ghidra
    Hybrid Analysis
    ILSpy
    JD-GUI
    Notepad++
    Process Monitor
    VirusTotal
    Wireshark
    X64DBG
    YARA

1.Autoruns

    Introduction:
        Autoruns is an independent tool included in the Sysinternals utilities (Microsoft, 2022). It was designed to display auto-starting Windows applications. While the Windows system has provided methods to view start-ups, Autoruns does more than the built-in functionality by aggregating startup programs, Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, etc.

2.ANY.RUN

    Introduction:
        ANY.RUN (or at least the community edition that was evaluated) manages to complete in 60 seconds what most tools can require days to attempt. It creates a skeleton of the sample and begins to connect those dots using timelines, graphs, kill chains, and network logs, all of which can paint a clearer picture of the sample for an analyst.
        What ANY.RUN will not do is reverse engineer the malware. It cannot explain (with the community edition at least) exactly how a process was injected, a privilege escalated, or a C2 command received. ANY.RUN is best used to provide a map of a given sample, with which an analyst can download extracted (unpacked) executables, follow the killchain, and analyse the sample statically or dynamically with a plan of attack, rather than attempting the task blindly. That is to say that ANY.RUN should be used as a guide during analysis, but not replace the analysis.

3.Detect It Easy
    Introduction:
        DIE aids static analysis with other tools by providing the PE type, compiler, and linker used to create the binary. It also yields the hash of the binary, as well as internal sections. It indicates the sample is unpacked, its entropy, the entropy of PE sections, and provides clues as to the origin of the sample by incorporating the ability for it to be scanned with signature detection (often uncovering the type of packer used). The full suite of DIE’s features are covered in the running sheet, although it should be noted DIE is extensible using open source modules.

4.Ghidra
    Introduction:
        Ghidra is a framework, rather than a tool, and comes equipped with the ability to fully statically analyse, decompile, and express a binary, but also includes the ability to dynamically analyse a sample as well. The two features were released separately however, with one seemingly being more mature than the other.

5.Hybrid Analysis
    Introduction:
        Hybrid Analysis is powered by Falcon Sandbox, which analyses threats, correlates the results with threat intelligence and presents indicators of compromise. While it has the ability to search for existent reports, it can also configure the runtime environment and perform real-time analysis of the uploaded file.

6.ILSpy
    Introduction:
        ILSpy is an open-source de-compilation tool for .Net programs. It can de-compile .Net programs and produce de-compiled C# code / project.

7.JD-GUI
    Introduction:
        JD-GUI is an extremely simple tool and attempts to perform one task, albeit very well. JD-GUI decompiles Java archives back into human readable form. The code it produces isn't just clean and legible, it often recovers the full suite of metadate from the Java archive, preserving class/variable names, the exact imports used, and when class/variable names are unavailable it almost always detects and assigns names that provide added context for the analyst. This made viewing the AdWind sample a breeze.

8.Notepad++
    Introduction:
        Notepad++ has been included as it is a simple, open-source text editor that also happens to save modified files without attempting to reformat them.

9.Process Monitor
    Introduction:
        Process Monitor (commonly referred to as ‘Procmon’) is an excellent tool. It is easy to use and comes with a very user-friendly interface, whereby even novice malware analysts or system administrators can very quickly filter to find the information they want and isolate it from adjacent noise.
        Procmon works by capturing every event within a time period, allowing it to be navigated by a set of default filters, or further analysed by more in-depth user created filters.

10.VirusTotal
    Introduction:
        VirusTotal is an online sandbox which can analyse file, URL, hash, domain, IP address. A thorough report can be retrieved, which includes security vendors’ detection result, file details, relations, behaviours, and community comments. While the user can start analysing a single instance by accessing its official website, VirusTotal also supports automated search via its API. VTAPI provides a detailed guide of acquiring VirusTotal search result in different languages via its API.

11.Wireshark
    Introduction:
        Wireshark (formerly ethereal) is a network packet analysis software. The function of the network packet analysis software is to intercept network packets and display the most detailed network packet data as far as possible. Wireshark uses WinPcap as its interface to exchange data messages directly with the network card. Under the guarantee of GNU General Public License, users can obtain the software and its source code free of charge and have the right to modify and customise its source code.

12.X64DBG
    Introduction:
        X64DBG is an open-source and well-maintained tool that rivals IDA Pro in a variety of ways, at least on the topic of dynamic analysis. X64DBG offers debug functionality (including step-over/step-into) with an easy-to-read GUI. Full details of the binary including listing symbols, imports, an active memory map, the stack, a window devoted to displaying the binary in bytes, and much more.

13.YARA
    Introduction:
        YARA is a fantastic pattern matching tool that is extremely performant (when compared to regex and other common utilities) and has a wide variety of use cases beyond simple malware detection.
        YARA works by defining binary signatures within ‘YARA Rules’, and then testing binaries against these rules to produce either a True or False result. These rules can be relatively simple, by only identifying specific bytes, addresses, strings, or hashes. They can also become very complex and modular, not only identifying malicious samples but combining signatures to detect strains and families of malware based on shared traits.
